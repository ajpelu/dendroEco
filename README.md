dendroEco: Functions to compute DendroEcological Analysis
=========================================================

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/ajpelu/dendroEco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ajpelu/dendroEco)

The goal of dendroEco is to compile functions for computing dendroecological analysis. It was developed within a research project which analyzed the response of *Quercus pyrenaica* forests of Sierra Nevada (southern Spani) to consecutive drought events.

Installation
------------

You can install the released version of dendroEco from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
